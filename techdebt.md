### Investigate and Fix MUI Grid Type Errors in `app/analytics/page.tsx`

**Description:**

The `app/analytics/page.tsx` file currently uses `// @ts-ignore` to suppress TypeScript errors related to the MUI `Grid` component (specifically when using `Grid item` with responsive props like `xs`, `md`, etc.). The build was failing due to errors like "Property 'item' does not exist on type..." or "Property 'component' is missing...".

While `@ts-ignore` allows the project to build, it's a workaround and hides a potential underlying type definition or compatibility issue between MUI, TypeScript, and Next.js versions used in the project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Remove all `// @ts-ignore` instances related to MUI `Grid` in `app/analytics/page.tsx`.
*   The project must build successfully without these TypeScript errors.
*   The layout rendered by the `Grid` components must remain the same as it was with `@ts-ignore`.

**Possible Investigation Steps:**
*   Verify compatibility between installed versions of `@mui/material`, `typescript`, `react`, `@types/react`, and `next`.
*   Check MUI's official documentation and GitHub issues for similar problems with the specific versions used.
*   Experiment with different import methods for `Grid` (though standard named import from `@mui/material` was used).
*   Review `tsconfig.json` for any subtle configurations that might affect type resolution (though it appeared standard).
*   Test a minimal reproduction of the `Grid` usage in a clean page/project to isolate the issue.
*   Consider if other global types or project configurations might be conflicting.
