# Enhanced Evidence Upload Feature

This document outlines the enhanced evidence upload features implemented based on user feedback. The improvements focus on making evidence management more comprehensive, user-friendly, and robust.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Delete/Edit Capability
- Users can now edit existing evidence notes and tags
- Delete functionality allows removing irrelevant evidence
- Appropriate permission checks ensure only authorized users can modify evidence
- Soft deletion preserves data integrity while allowing for cleanup

### 2. Bulk Upload Option
- Multiple files can be selected and uploaded at once
- Each file is uploaded as a separate evidence item but shares the same notes and tags
- Improved UI shows preview of selected files with file size information
- Ability to remove files from the upload queue before submission

### 3. Evidence Tagging System
- Predefined tag categories for consistent organization:
  - Documentation, Metrics, Process, Training, Implementation, Results, Planning, Other
- Multiple tags can be applied to each evidence item
- Tags are visually displayed with each evidence entry
- Tags are searchable for quick filtering

### 4. Evidence Search and Filtering
- Real-time search across evidence items
- Search works across notes, tags, and file types
- Clear feedback when no results match search criteria
- Efficient filtering preserves all evidence data while showing only relevant items

### 5. Automatic Evidence Naming Conventions
- Files are renamed during upload following a consistent pattern:
  - Format: `dimensionId_date_originalFilename`
- Sanitization of filenames to remove problematic characters
- Ensures consistent organization of evidence files on the server
- Prevents filename collisions while maintaining traceability

### 6. Version Control for Evidence
- Each evidence item tracks its version number
- When evidence is edited, previous versions are preserved in history
- Full version history is viewable for each evidence item
- All changes are traceable with timestamps and user information

### 7. Mobile-Friendly Uploads
- Responsive design works well on mobile devices
- Direct camera integration for capturing evidence on-site
- Optimized UI for touch interactions on smaller screens
- Mobile-aware file size considerations and compression

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
The following updates were made to the Prisma schema:

1. **Evidence Model Updates**:
   - Added `tags` field as string array
   - Added `version` counter field
   - Added `updatedAt` timestamp field
   - Added relation to EvidenceHistory

2. **New EvidenceHistory Model**:
   - Tracks previous versions of evidence
   - Stores all version metadata including file URLs, notes, and tags
   - Links back to the original evidence

### API Endpoints
New and updated API endpoints to support these features:

1. **GET** `/api/assessments/[assessmentId]/dimensions/[dimensionId]/evidence`:
   - Enhanced to return tags and version information

2. **POST** `/api/assessments/[assessmentId]/dimensions/[dimensionId]/evidence`:
   - Updated to handle tags and automatic filename generation
   - Supports bulk upload through multiple files

3. **PUT** `/api/assessments/[assessmentId]/dimensions/[dimensionId]/evidence/[evidenceId]`:
   - New endpoint for updating evidence
   - Creates version history before updating
   - Handles permission checks

4. **DELETE** `/api/assessments/[assessmentId]/dimensions/[dimensionId]/evidence/[evidenceId]`:
   - New endpoint for removing evidence
   - Implements soft deletion
   - Handles file removal from storage

5. **GET** `/api/assessments/[assessmentId]/dimensions/[dimensionId]/evidence/[evidenceId]/history`:
   - New endpoint for retrieving version history
   - Returns chronological list of all versions

### User Interface Updates
The EvidenceUpload component has been completely redesigned with:

1. **Modern UI Elements**:
   - Material UI components for consistent look and feel
   - Intuitive icons and interactive elements
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Clearer feedback during uploads
   - More informative error messages
   - Visual indicators for processing states

3. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - Modal dialogs for editing evidence
   - Version history viewer
   - Search and filtering controls
   - Tag management interface

## Database Migration

A migration script (`prisma/migrations/evidence_updates.sql`) has been created to:
1. Add new columns to the Evidence table
2. Create the EvidenceHistory table
3. Set up appropriate indexes and constraints

To apply these changes, run the migration script against your database.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to consider:
1. Evidence approval workflow
2. Required evidence flags for critical dimensions
3. Evidence templating system
4. Advanced filtering by date, user, and other metadata
5. Bulk operations for existing evidence items
